# Thomas Travels – Java Mini Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Java mini project** developed to practice **Core Java, OOPS concepts, and Collections (ArrayList)** using a real-world inspired problem.

The application manages drivers for a travel service and performs operations like searching, filtering, and aggregation using object-oriented design.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)
- OOPS Concepts
- Collections Framework (ArrayList)
- Eclipse IDE

---

## 📂 Project Structure
com
├── Driver.java // Model class (Driver details)
├── Travel.java // Business logic
└── TestDriver.java // Testing and execution


---

## 🔑 Features Implemented
- Create and manage Driver objects
- Store multiple drivers using `ArrayList`
- Check whether a driver belongs to Car category
- Retrieve driver details by Driver ID
- Count drivers based on category
- Retrieve all drivers of a specific category
- Find the driver who traveled the maximum distance

---

## 🧠 Java Concepts Practiced
- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- Method design & return types
- ArrayList with objects
- Enhanced for-loops
- String handling
- Method overriding (`toString()`)
- Separation of concerns (Model / Logic / Testing)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**
3. Run `TestDriver.java`
4. View output in the console

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
- How to convert real-world requirements into Java classes
- How to design methods based on responsibility
- How to work with collections of objects
- How OOPS concepts are applied in backend development

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement using Java Streams
- Extend this project using Spring Boot & JDBC
